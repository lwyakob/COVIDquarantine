## General info
Distributions of prepatent and latent periods of COVID-19 are used to estimate 95% Prediction Intervals for threshold isolation proportions to interupt transmission.
These thresholds are calculated for a full range of plausible Reproduction numbers.

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.8

 ## Setup
Following modules must be installed: matplotlib.pyplot; numpy; scipy; scipy.stats; inset_axes; matplotlib.colors; scipy.ndimage; resample; curve_fit; reliability; reliability.Distributions; matplotlib.patches; LabelLines

## Features
* Basic Quarantine threshold (borrowed from vaccination threshold maths)
* Random sampler for creating a pdf of time delays between infectiousness and symtoms onset
* Isolation thresholds accounting for different asymptomatic rates

## Status
Project is: _finished_
